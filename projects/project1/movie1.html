     <p> <p style="color:White;" > The Dirt is an almost two hour long movie that focuses on the major turning events for the 1980s rock band, Motley Crue. The plot includes events based on the true experiences of all members of the band on their journey to success and fame while struggling with drug addictions and emotional issues with themselves. Generally, the movie shows the rise and growth of the band and the development of all characters/members based off the actions taken after life-altering events. I was interested in this movie because of my interest in rock music. </p>
