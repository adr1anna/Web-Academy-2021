     <p> <p style="color:White;" >The Devil's Rejects is an almost two hour thriller movie that features a reunited family and their continuous murder spree that goes on as they are watched by the cops and run from place to place in order to remain free and survive. The concept of the film and its plot are based similarly to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This movie interested me because I liked the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie.</p>
