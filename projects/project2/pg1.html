    <p>To have positive intentions generally means to have a morally upright meaning behind the decisions you make. This however, is very dependent on our conscience or our interpretation of right from wrong and good from bad. When we decide to do something, we do it while meaning for them to have a positive outcome. Usually, since the outcomes of our actions overtake or disregard our intentions, they aren't even valuable unless these results reflect what was intended. A good example could include when you lie. Lying with good intentions can be morally acceptable as long as it is for the proper purpose. Positive intentions could mean to carry positive traits. To be considerate and be able to act selflessly shows that we can have good meaning behind the things we do, not just because we deem them in this manner , but because they are meant with good energy and spirit. If our actions are considered and carried out with these positive intentions, we do not have to worry about our moral principals living up to the practical expectations of society. Here we can feel good about our choices. </p>
