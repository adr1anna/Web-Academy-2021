    <p>To have negative intentions generally means to lean towards the bad side in terms of our moral standards. Typically we see cases where actions are carried out with positive intent and unexpectadely reveal negative results. On the other hand, to start out with negative intentions means to not have our priorieties in line. To go about in the world while purposfully spreading negativity and trying to go about situations in a vengeful and selfish way, means to live a life blinded by a pessimistic perspective.</p>
