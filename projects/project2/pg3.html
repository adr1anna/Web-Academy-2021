    <p>Intentions mean much more on a spiritual scale. When we look at things how they are we see them as good or bad which is previously explained throughout this site. Directly, we see what is acceptable based on the situation and even the outcome of our actions. If we think about this spiritually, we see what we are willing to spread as a reflection of ourselves. Our souls are shown by the things we do. This defines our character and can help the universe discover what we individually deserve. Spiritual intentions support us in releasing our emtotions for our souls to evolve. </p>
