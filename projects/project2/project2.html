     <p>Choices define our entire life. Some may view this to be the main aspect that dictates the purpose of our existence. What we don't consider is the reasoning behind our choices. These contain the main source: our intentions. Intentions hold the deeper and true meaning of these decisions, the decisions that ultimately decide our faith. This can include the way we react, the problems we solve, the problems we create and, in the end, how we end up. To break this down, we react by expressing how we feel, solve our problems by considering our best interests, create them because life is powered on problems rooted from these choices, and how we end up because all our decisions lead to our final moments.</p>

      <p>Intentions are one of the most important values in life. They are the reason we make certain decisions and do the things we do. They reveal our motivation and our true feelings about the positions that we may find ourselves in throughout our lifetime. Intentions hold strong meaning that may not be directly shown, but can be the key to the course of action or even the overall path we take in life. To me, intentions are the key to communication and help to verify our connections with each other. Intentions not only hold our true feelings and determine how we act towards each other, but also develop our personal goals and experiences by what we think is best for ourselves. And although we do choose to take these courses ourselves, we may subconciously use our intentions to guide us. This is not just an external value but it is also something we find important to define ourselves.</p>
